# Facebook Ad Creative Concepts

Due to current generation limits, the following are detailed visual concepts you can use to generate images or brief a designer.

## Concept 1: The Direct Source
**Matching Angle**: Direct Manufacturer Access
**Visual Goal**: Illustrate scale, supply, and "behind the scenes" access.

**Prompt / Description**:
> A professional, high-resolution shot of a modern logistics warehouse or factory floor. Shallow depth of field focusing on a branded package or a worker checking a clipboard. Lighting should be bright and cleaner than a typical gritty factory—think "Apple of Logistics".
>
> **Overlay Text**: "Direct from Factory"
>
> **Generated Asset**: `marketing/ad_1_warehouse.png`

## Concept 2: The Infinite Shelf
**Matching Angle**: One-Stop Sourcing
**Visual Goal**: Show variety and abundance without clutter.

**Prompt / Description**:
> A top-down "flat lay" photography composition on a sleek solid color background (emerald green or slate grey). Neatly arranged grid of various fast-selling items: smartwatches, TWS earbuds, braided cables, and phone cases.
>
> **Overlay Text**: "Everything You Need"
>
> **Generated Asset**: `marketing/ad_2_variety.png`

## Concept 3: Verified Trust
**Matching Angle**: Trust & Safety
**Visual Goal**: Convey security and partnership.

**Prompt / Description**:
> A close-up business photography shot of a confident handshake between two professionals, or a retailer smiling while holding a quality product. Superimposed 3D glass-morphism shield icon or a "Verified" tick mark in D2BCart green colors.
>
> **Overlay Text**: "100% Verified Sellers"
>
> **Generated Asset**: `marketing/ad_3_trust.png`
